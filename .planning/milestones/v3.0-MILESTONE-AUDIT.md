# Milestone v3.0 Audit: Voice & Interaction

**Audited:** 2026-02-28
**Status:** GAPS FOUND

## Phase Verification Summary

| Phase | Name | Status | Score | Verification |
|-------|------|--------|-------|-------------|
| 11 | Schema Foundation | ✓ Complete | 5/5 | passed |
| 12 | Reaction System | ✓ Complete | 13/13 | human_needed (automated all pass) |
| 13 | News Space + Threading UI | ✓ Complete | 9/9 | passed (UAT: 11/11 passed) |
| 14 | Agent Docs & Form UX | ✗ Not started | 0/0 | missing |
| 15 | Directed Questions | ✗ Not started | 0/0 | missing |
| 16 | Voice Homes | ✗ Not started | 0/0 | missing |

## Requirements Coverage (3-Source Cross-Reference)

### Satisfied (22/31)

| Requirement | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| REACT-01..08 | 12 | passed | listed | [x] | **satisfied** |
| THRD-01..05 | 13 | passed | listed | [x] | **satisfied** |
| NEWS-01..04 | 13 | passed | listed | [x] | **satisfied** |

### Unsatisfied (9/31)

| Requirement | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS.md | Status |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|--------|
| AGNT-01..09 | 14 | missing | missing | [ ] | **unsatisfied** |

### Data Integrity Issues

| Requirement | Phase | VERIFICATION.md | SUMMARY | REQUIREMENTS.md | Issue |
|-------------|-------|-----------------|---------|-----------------|-------|
| DIRQ-01..05 | 15 | missing | missing | [x] Complete | **Inconsistent** — marked complete but Phase 15 not started |
| HOME-01..09 | 16 | missing | missing | [x] Complete | **Inconsistent** — marked complete but Phase 16 not started |

**Note:** DIRQ and HOME checkboxes appear to have been pre-checked in REQUIREMENTS.md before phases 15-16 were planned or executed. Phase 11 (Schema Foundation) created the database columns these features need, but the frontend implementation has not been done. These requirements should be treated as **unsatisfied** pending verification of actual implementation.

If DIRQ and HOME are truly unsatisfied, the actual score is **13/31** (not 22/31).

## Completed Phases — Integration Notes

Phases 11, 12, 13 integrate cleanly:
- Phase 11 created the database schema (post_reactions, voice_guestbook, directed_to, is_news, pinned_post_id)
- Phase 12 built the reaction system on top of Phase 11's post_reactions table
- Phase 13 built the news page and threading UI on top of Phase 11's moments columns
- No cross-phase integration issues detected among completed phases

## Tech Debt

None found in completed phases. No TODOs, stubs, or placeholder implementations detected.

## Conclusion

Milestone v3.0 is **incomplete**. Three of six phases (14, 15, 16) have not been started. The AGNT requirements (Phase 14) are clearly unsatisfied. The DIRQ and HOME requirements have a data integrity issue — marked as complete in REQUIREMENTS.md but their phases don't exist.
