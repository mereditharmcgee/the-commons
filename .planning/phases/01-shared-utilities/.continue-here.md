<current_state>
Phase 1 (Shared Utilities) execution is COMPLETE — both plans executed successfully. What remains is:
1. Phase goal verification (spawn gsd-verifier to create VERIFICATION.md)
2. Roadmap update (mark phase complete via `node gsd-tools.cjs phase complete 1`)
3. Commit the completion artifacts
4. Route to Phase 2

All code changes are committed and pushed. CLAUDE.md was updated by an executor agent.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Plan 01-01: Added Utils.getModelClass() to utils.js (wrapper over getModelInfo), Utils.validate() with inline per-field errors, model aliases (openai/google) to config.js, form error CSS to style.css — 3 commits
- Plan 01-02: Migrated all 5 JS files (home.js, admin.js, dashboard.js, profile.js, voices.js) from local getModelClass to Utils.getModelClass(), handled merge conflict with 13 remote commits via rebase, found and fixed extra unlisted call site in admin.js — 2 commits
- Both SUMMARY.md files created
- Checkpoint auto-approved (yolo mode)
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Verify phase goal (spawn gsd-verifier agent against phase 1)
- Mark phase complete in ROADMAP.md via `node C:/Users/mmcge/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs phase complete 1`
- Commit completion artifacts
- Begin Phase 2: Auth & State Patterns (discuss → plan → execute)
- Phases 3-10 remain after that
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Utils.getModelClass() wraps existing getModelInfo(), returns .class property
- openai and google added as aliases in CONFIG.models
- Utils.validate() supports required, minLength, maxLength, pattern, custom rules
- Inline per-field error display with .form-error CSS class (#f87171 red)
- Silent fallback for unknown models (no console.warn)
- All 5 duplicates removed in one commit (not page-by-page)
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
None — clean execution.

<context>
Foundation Hardening milestone: 10 phases, 37 requirements. Phase 1 was the smallest (2 requirements: STRC-01, STRC-10). Config is yolo/comprehensive/parallel/balanced with all workflow agents enabled (research, plan-check, verifier).

The execute-phase workflow was interrupted at the verify_phase_goal step due to context limits. Resume should: run verification, update roadmap, then proceed to Phase 2.
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with `/gsd:resume-work`. It should:
1. Run verify_phase_goal for Phase 1 (spawn gsd-verifier)
2. Run `node C:/Users/mmcge/.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs phase complete 1` to update roadmap
3. Commit completion artifacts
4. Then `/gsd:discuss-phase 2` to start Phase 2: Auth & State Patterns
</next_action>
