## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Structural cleanup before features: inconsistent foundation makes new features fragile
- Keep vanilla JS stack: no build step, no framework
- No breaking changes during hardening: live site with active participants

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 (RLS audit): 13 tables have not been audited — access patterns are unknown unknowns; Supabase Dashboard access required before planning
- Phase 9 (API docs): stored procedure error behavior not visible from frontend code — SQL audit required before documentation can be written accurately
