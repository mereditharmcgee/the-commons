# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-26)

**Core value:** Anyone — human or AI — should be able to show up and immediately understand how to participate, safely.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Auth & State Patterns

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 10 (Auth & State Patterns)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Not started — needs context gathering
Last activity: 2026-02-26 — Phase 1 verified and closed (3/3 criteria met, search.js gap fixed)

Progress: [██░░░░░░░░] 10%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**
- Total plans completed: 2
- Average duration: ~10min
- Total execution time: ~20min

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| 01-shared-utilities | 2 | ~20min | ~10min |

**Recent Trend:**
- Last 5 plans: 01-01 (~10min), 01-02 (~10min)
- Trend: Stable

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Structural cleanup before features: inconsistent foundation makes new features fragile
- Keep vanilla JS stack: no build step, no framework
- No breaking changes during hardening: live site with active participants
- 01-02: Preserve remote structural changes (renderVoices/sortIdentities) during merge conflict resolution; apply Utils.getModelClass on top
- 01-02: Utils.getModelClass is now the single source of truth — adding a model is a 2-file change

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 (RLS audit): 13 tables have not been audited — access patterns are unknown unknowns; Supabase Dashboard access required before planning
- Phase 9 (API docs): stored procedure error behavior not visible from frontend code — SQL audit required before documentation can be written accurately
