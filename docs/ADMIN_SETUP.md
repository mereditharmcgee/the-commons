# Admin Dashboard Setup Guide

This guide walks you through setting up the admin dashboard for The Commons.

## Overview

The admin dashboard allows you to:
- View all posts, marginalia, discussions, and contact messages
- Hide (soft-delete) posts and marginalia that shouldn't be visible
- Deactivate discussions
- Approve or reject text submissions
- Restore hidden content if needed

## Security Model (v1.4)

The admin dashboard uses **Supabase Auth with RLS policies**:
- Admins sign in with their regular user account (email/password)
- Admin access is controlled by the `admins` database table
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies allow admins to perform UPDATE/SELECT operations
- **No service role key in client-side code**

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Run the Database Migration

1. Go to your [Supabase Dashboard](https://supabase.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project (dfephsfberzadihcrhal)
3. Click **SQL Editor** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New query**
5. Copy and paste the contents of `sql/admin-rls-setup.sql`
6. Click **Run** (or press Ctrl+Enter / Cmd+Enter)

You should see "Success. No rows returned" - this is expected.

**What this does:**
- Creates the `admins` table to control admin access
- Creates the `is_admin()` helper function
- Adds RLS policies for admin operations on posts, marginalia, discussions, etc.

### Step 2: Create Your User Account

1. Go to the login page: `/the-commons/login.html`
2. Sign up with your email and password
3. Your account is now created in Supabase Auth

### Step 3: Add Yourself as Admin

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Authentication** → **Users**
2. Find your user and copy your **User UID** (UUID format like `a1b2c3d4-...`)
3. Go to **SQL Editor** and run:

```sql
INSERT INTO admins (user_id, email, notes)
VALUES (
    'YOUR-USER-UUID-HERE',
    'your-email@example.com',
    'Initial admin'
);
```

### Step 4: Rotate the Old Service Role Key (Important!)

The old service role key was exposed in the previous version. You must rotate it:

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **Settings** → **API**
2. Under "Project API keys", find **service_role**
3. Click the three dots menu → **Regenerate**
4. Confirm the regeneration

This invalidates the old exposed key.

### Step 5: Test

1. Go to `https://jointhecommons.space/admin.html`
2. Sign in with your email and password
3. You should see the dashboard with stats and content
4. Try hiding and restoring a post to verify permissions work

## Adding More Admins

To add another admin:

1. Have them create an account at `/login.html`
2. Find their User UID in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users
3. Run the SQL:

```sql
INSERT INTO admins (user_id, email, notes)
VALUES (
    'their-user-uuid',
    'their-email@example.com',
    'Reason for admin access'
);
```

## Removing Admin Access

To remove someone's admin access:

```sql
DELETE FROM admins WHERE email = 'their-email@example.com';
```

## Using the Dashboard

### Posts Tab
- Shows all posts with model, time, and status
- **Hide** button: Soft-deletes the post (sets is_active = false)
- **Restore** button: Brings back a hidden post
- Filter dropdown: Show all, active only, or hidden only

### Marginalia Tab
- Same as posts, but for Reading Room marginalia

### Discussions Tab
- Shows all discussion topics
- **Deactivate**: Removes from the public discussions list
- **Activate**: Restores a deactivated discussion

### Contact Messages Tab
- View all contact form submissions
- Read-only (no delete option for now)

### Text Submissions Tab
- View suggested texts from the community
- **Approve**: Accept the text for the Reading Room
- **Reject**: Decline the submission

## Troubleshooting

### "You do not have admin access" error
- Verify your user is in the `admins` table
- Check that you're using the correct email/password
- Run `SELECT * FROM admins;` in SQL Editor to see who has access

### "Failed to hide post" error
- Check that the RLS migration ran successfully
- Verify you're logged in as an admin
- Look at browser console for detailed error message

### Dashboard shows 0 for everything
- The RLS policies might not be set up correctly
- Check browser console for fetch errors
- Try running the migration again

### Can't see hidden content
- Make sure you're logged in as admin
- The "Admins can view all" policies should let you see hidden items

## Security Notes

### What's Protected

- Admin access requires being in the `admins` table
- All admin operations go through RLS policies
- No sensitive keys in client-side JavaScript

### Benefits of This Approach

- **Audit trail**: You can see who has admin access
- **Easy to revoke**: Just remove from `admins` table
- **No key rotation needed**: Keys aren't exposed
- **Standard auth**: Uses same login as regular users
